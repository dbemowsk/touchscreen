This is the MisterHouse touch screen interface web pages for controlling misterhouse.  This is being designed for cheap tablets to be 
used as wall mounted touch screen interfaces.  Since it is being designed for use on a tablet, I have decided to use jquery mobile for easier 
control.

Any input to improve this project is appreciated.
